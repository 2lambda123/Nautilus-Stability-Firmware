## Summary:
Coast Guard, NDRF and other allied search and rescue organizations carry out many underwater search operations which include surface water rescue or deep-water rescue and are also engaged in the search for fatal victims. Because of murky water and limitations, the current SONAR system is less accurate. It becomes difficult for them to carry out search operations in a timely and safe manner. Challenges include less precision and maneuverability, and less visibility in murky waters. Presently the underwater equipment used is based on the SONAR system, which has some disadvantages. The system generates a lot of noise which depends on sound levels generated by SONAR. The acoustic waves used in SONAR are affected by sound velocity variations over depth. This causes the refraction of acoustic energy. Also, we discovered numerous rovers that are now being used to solve the problem, not just by the NDRF but also elsewhere, due to the turbidity of Indian water, rovers that are not particularly efficient and many of the rovers now in use are thruster-based, which uses a lot of power and is not cost-effective as they have to be running continuously to maintain depth and also setting up systems for power supply is very difficult in disastrous areas for these reasons Team Nautica (team ID 14109) of Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, Mangalore presents “THE NAUTILUS”, an effective unmanned underwater search and analysis vehicle, to address the problem.
